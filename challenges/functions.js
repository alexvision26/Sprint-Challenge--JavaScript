// ==== Callbacks ====  

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function
  * Create a higher-order function named consume with 3 parameters: a, b and cb
  * The first two parameters can take any argument (we can pass any value as argument)
  * The last parameter accepts a callback
  * The consume function should return the invocation of cb, passing a and b into cb as arguments
*/

function consume (a, b, cb){
  return cb(a, b);
}


/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
  * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
  * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers 
  * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
*/

function add(num1, num2){
  return num1 + num2;
}

function multiply(num1, num2){
  return num1 * num2;
}

function greeting(first, last){
  return `Hello ${first} ${last}, nice to meet you!`
}


/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
console.log(consume(2, 2, add)); // 4
console.log(consume(10, 16, multiply)); // 160
console.log(consume("Mary", "Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!


// ==== Closures ==== 

// Explain in your own words why nestedfunction can access the variable internal.

// Explanation: The reason nestedFunction can access the variable, 'internal' is because it is in the parent of the function. It is also outside the scope of function and function can look outside the their scope to access variables. When data or a variable is inside another function that is outside of it's scope, the function cannot access the variable. In this case, the nestedFunction is still within myFunction so it can access it. But if nestedFunction was not within myFunction, it would not have access to the variable, 'internal'.


const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
